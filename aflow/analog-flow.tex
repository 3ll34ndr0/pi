  \vspace{-0.5cm}
  \tiny{
    \textbf{Introducci\'on}
    \begin{itemize}
	\item Un flujo de dise\~no est\'a compuesto por un programa espec\'ifico para cada tarea, e interfaces y formatos comunes para pasar de una etapa a la otra del dise \~no.
	\item Al mismo tiempo, seg\'un avanzan los procesos de fabricaci\'on, tambi\'en cambian las herramientas.
	\item Las herramientas fueron estudiadas por separado teniendo en cuenta la posibilidad de integraci\'on con otras, libres o no, necesario cuando se llega al punto de no encontrar herramientas libres.
	\item Teniendo encuenta estos items, y mirando los testbenches de los dise\~nadores fu\'e encarado este estudio
%    \item Europractice posee una lista de precios de herramientas no libres, para las universidades.

    \textbf{Gnucap:}
	\begin{itemize}
      	\item \textbf{Pros:} Fast simulator. Fully scriptable. Scales better than ngspice and LTSpice. Usefull plug-ins system to use other netlist
syntax (such as spectre, spice3f5, verilog-ams) or compile new simulation models without compiling
the whole simulator. There is a fork which implements icarus verilog cosimulation, mot-adms model compiler, among
other minor enhancements.
      	\item Due to its plug-in system, it inherits some feature improvements done on other free simulators such as ngspice. It also allows easier development of features.
      	\item Digital Verilog cosimulation is possible replacing PWL device for a verilog circuit. 
      	\item Icarus Verilog-AMS simulation will be available for cosimulation when implemented. Not there yet.
      	\item \textbf{Cons:} Lacks some simulation analisys such as noise (which is being developed now, not yet available for beta testing) or PSS.
      	\item Verilog-AMS not yet available, testbenches are more script oriented handcrafted. Coding skills needed.
	\end{itemize}

    \textbf{Ngspice:}
	\begin{itemize}
      	\item Merges 3 different simulators: Berkeley spice3f5, Cider and Xspice which gives us a mixed-signal/mixed-level simulator.
      	\item \textbf{ Pros:} Widely used and support several analysis and compact simulation models, mot-adms model compiler can be used for verilog-ams models. Output can be
retrieved by the electric waveform viewer, or using its built-in viewer.
      	\item \textbf{Cons:} It is slower than gnucap and needs to be recompiled when a new simulation model is added.
    \end{itemize}
  %\vspace{-0.5cm}
  
    \textbf{LTSpice:}
	\begin{itemize}
      	\item The same ngspice pros and cons' applies to LTSpice. It is not free software, but its license allows it to be used for almost all industrial scenario.

    \textbf{Electric VLSI:}
    
      	\newline Schematic, Layout, DRC, LVS, spice netlist
\begin{itemize}
      	\item \textbf{Pros:} Actively maintained: fast bugs corrections, periodic releases with new features. 
      	\item Netlisting generator targets several simulators
      	\item Waveform viewer accepts several simulator data output
      	\item TSMC PDK avaiable for 180nm, 90nm and 45nm and even can export cells to SKILL 
	\item Can read DRC error output from Cadence and Menotor tools
	 
      	\item \textbf{Cons:} Schematic lacks finger/multiplier params, Layout is done in a different way, but easy to learn

    \textbf{Magic VLSI:}
    \newline We use only \textbf{parasitic extraction} and netlist generation feature of this layout tool
\begin{itemize}
      	\item \textbf{Pros:} More accurate than Electric, widely used for old processes (0.25um and above)
\item \textbf{Cons:} Need to write another techfile for this tool
\item Not acceptable for nanometer processes.Schematic, Layout, DRC, LVS, spice netlist

  \textbf{Cadence calculator replacement:}
\newline \textbf{Numpy} library can be used as a tool to postprocess simulation results (ascii data in gnucap and spice raw format in ngspice) It is a matlab replacement also. 
\newline \textbf{Matplolib} is a library that can be used to view the simulation results. Electric waveform viewer can be used also (not for gnucap results)

\begin{itemize}
      	\item Pros: Very flexible tools, known as a easy replacement for matlab 
      	\item Cons: This methodology can be slower for designers that are used to Cadence tools. CAD engineer or the designer should prepare a set of common task before start designing.

\begin{slide}{ \textsc{{\tiny Flujo de Dise\~no Anal\'ogico basado en Software Libre}}\\ Conclusions}
  \vspace{-0.5cm}
  \tiny{
\begin{itemize}
\item Before start choosing a tool, process technology must be defined.
\item Tools can be replaced one by one, not necesary to forge an entirely custom workflow.
\item Tasks more likely to being replaced Cadence workflow is schematic and layout design, depending on the technology process.
\item Most of these tools are actively developed, so it is recommended (if not compulsory) compiling and coding skills.

%Tiene que haber alguien que se encargue de hacer ejemplos de uso de cada nueva herramienta (numpy, matplot lib, etc)
\item To help ease the change, well documented examples for every task should be available (expecially for numpy, matplotlib and handcrafted testbenches scripts)
\item Previous survey on asitic turns to be very usefull now.

\textbf{Future work}
\begin{itemize}
\item Test simulator with large nets to be sure that we don't hit a tool limit when doing production everday work. We should be able to use extracted netlist from QRC Cadence of a real block designed in CASA.
\item Try to export data to allow visibility of CASA blocks for INC database.
